# Sorting-Algorithm visualizer

This is a project to visualize various sorting algorithms.

I used this to learn the go programming language, so the code might not be optimised yet.

## Here are the visualisations created with go:

### Bubblesort

A very simple sorting algorithm, which works by comparing two adjacent numbers (or pixels in this case) and moving the bigger one up.

### Insertionsort

# Todos:

- Implement more algorithms
- Write time-complexity for every algorithms
